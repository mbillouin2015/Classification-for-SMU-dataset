# Classification-for-SMU-dataset

For my project, I propose implementing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for binary classification. The scope of the project is to discriminate between events that produce infrasound signals, low-frequency acoustic waves less than 20 Hz. During the period 2003 â€“ 2013, ground truth infrasonic arrivals were documented on the explosive disposal of rocket motors at the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) and extended rocket motor burn tests (RMT) of horizontally-oriented rockets at Promontory, Utah, studied at the Southern Methodist University. These two experiments will serve as the two classes in this binary classification problem. The data from these two experiments will be obtained through queries to the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) system, ensuring that the data for this classification task exists in the public domain. This dataset will henceforth be known as the SMU dataset. Some preprocessing will be applied to the timeseries data (e.g. resampling, filtering etc.) in order to standardize the dataset and improve classification results. If time permits, I will also use the MLP to perform classification of the SMU data in the frequency domain, using the flattened spectrograms. 

The expected outcome of this project is to have a model that can discriminate between events that produce infrasonic signals with high fidelity.
